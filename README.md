# HeartDiseaseAnalysis

## Heart Disease Anaylsis Project

This heart disease dataset, obtained from a reputable multispecialty hospital in India, contains a wealth of information with 14 common features, making it a valuable resource for cardiovascular research. Comprising data from 1,000 subjects and 12 distinct features, this dataset is instrumental in developing early-stage heart disease detection methods and constructing predictive machine-learning models. Its diverse and comprehensive nature makes it a significant asset for advancing research aimed at understanding and mitigating cardiovascular risks.

However, for the purpose of my learning and initial practice with basic coding and exercises, I will limit my work to basic statistical analysis and a simple dashboard.
